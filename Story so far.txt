Your Adventure in Aethel: The Story So Far

DM: The first thing you register is the cold. A deep, biting cold that seeps through damp wool and settles into your bones. It’s the cold of wet earth and morning dew. The second is the smell – acrid smoke, churned mud, and something else… something coppery and grim that clings to the back of your throat.

A groan escapes your lips, the sound foreign and raw. It belongs to the body you now inhabit. You force your eyes open.

The roof of the small hovel is gone, replaced by a bruised, grey sky weeping a miserable drizzle. Splintered timbers lie askew, and the wattle-and-daub walls are scorched black in great, weeping patches. Through the shattered doorway, you can see the rest of your world—or what’s left of it. The village is a ruin, a collection of smoldering pyres and skeletal remains of homes. Bodies, both human and goblin, lie contorted in the mud, their final moments frozen in silent tableaus of violence.

A flood of memories, not your own, washes over you. The face of a stern but loving man, his calloused hand resting on your shoulder—the town guard officer, your father. Then, the new memories, sharp and terrifying: the piercing shriek of a goblin horn, the screams, the sight of your father falling under a tide of snarling, green-skinned creatures as he shoved you into this very root cellar.

The grief of the boy is a sharp, physical pain in your chest. But beneath it, your own consciousness remains a point of cold, clear certainty. A familiar, silent hum resonates in your mind—the presence of your constant companion, the analytical engine you call Gemini.

A wave of purely internal data streams across your consciousness:

    Host Vitals Confirmed:

        Race: Human

        Age: 15 (approx.)

        Physiological Condition: Malnourished, minor contusions, adrenal fatigue.

    Core Attributes Assimilated:

        Strength (STR): 5

        Agility (AGI): 5

    Transmigrant Mind-State Integration:

        Intelligence (INT): 10

        Wisdom (WIS): 10

    Metaphysical Potential Analysis: Host exhibits a unique mind-body synthesis. Esoteric energy absorption can be optimized into direct biological augmentation. Projected Attribute Gain per Milestone: 6 points.

You push yourself up, the rough-spun tunic clinging uncomfortably to your skin. You are an orphan. A survivor. Standing in the ashes of a life that was never truly yours, but whose pain you now inherit.

What do you do?

Player: I get up and inspect my surroundings. I intend to scan the village and identify its state. A goblin invasion can only mean one thing: the men would have been slaughtered, the women captured. I head to the village elder’s house to verify if he has been slain.

DM: Your command flows through the neural pathways of this new body. You push yourself to your feet, joints creaking in protest. Stepping out from the ruined hovel, the full scope of the tragedy assaults your senses. Your mind, guided by Gemini, begins to catalog the scene with cold efficiency.

Analysis:

    Total structures: ~30, 95% structural loss.

    Human Casualties (observed): 18, all adult or elderly males.

    Goblin Casualties (observed): ~40-50.

    Crucial Observation: There are no bodies of women or children among the dead. Your hypothesis is correct. They were taken.

You navigate the grim tableau to the elder’s house. The door has been kicked in. Inside, in the center of the room, is Elder Theron. A crudely-made goblin spear is thrust through his chest, pinning him to the floorboards. His eyes are open, staring sightlessly at the ruined ceiling.

What do you do?

Player: I search the pantry of the village elder, the blacksmith, and the merchant’s home. Nourishment comes first.

DM: You set to the grim task of scavenging from the dead.
Roll: 78 (Success)

The elder's and blacksmith's pantries have been thoroughly ransacked, yielding only a small sack of raw potatoes. However, in the merchant's ruined home, you find a loose floorboard. Beneath is a small, hidden compartment the goblins missed entirely.

Inside, you find:

    A wheel of hard, wax-sealed cheese.

    A string of dried, smoked sausages.

    A leather waterskin, full of clean water.

    A small cloth bag containing a dozen dried apples.

With the immediate threat of starvation abated, you stand amidst the ruins. What do you do now?

Player: My next order of business is clothes, weapons, and money. I inspect the merchant’s house to find his son’s clothes, some weapons, and any currency.

DM: You return to the merchant’s ransacked home. You find a set of clothes belonging to the merchant’s son, a boy of similar age: a fine wool tunic, sturdy twill breeches, and most importantly, well-made boots of durable, water-resistant Saurian hide.

Searching for a weapon proves more challenging. However, behind a loose wall panel in the ruined shop, you find a hidden compartment for defense.

Inside, you find:

    A Shortsword

    A Hand Axe

    Three Throwing Knives

Your final task is looting.
Roll: 85 (High Success)

The common homes yield nothing. In the elder's house, you find a small box with the village's emergency fund. The real prize is back at the merchant's home, beneath a loose flagstone near the hearth, where you find a heavy leather pouch.

Your Total Haul:

    342 Copper Pieces (cp)

    151 Bronze Pieces (bp)

    23 Silver Pieces (sp)

You are fed, clothed, armed, and have a measure of wealth. Every path leads away from here. What do you do?

Player: Now it is time to look for transport. I recall that there should be a few pack mules owned by the merchant and even the farmers. I wonder if any of them survived.

DM: You begin a systematic search of the village’s periphery. The farmers' livestock have been slaughtered. Your last hope is the merchant’s stable.
Roll: 72 (Success)

Huddled in the far corner of the last stall is a single, dust-brown mule. Its eyes are wide with terror. As your eyes adjust, you notice a shallow, weeping gash on its left flank, likely from a goblin’s spiteful sword-swipe. Hanging on a set of pegs is a full set of tack: a bridle, a bit, and a pack saddle with two large, empty leather bags.

What do you do?

Player: I wonder if my knowledge of conceptual magic from past worlds works here. I place my hand near the wound as I glare at the mule, commanding it to stand still. I focus my mind and try to forcibly absorb the mana in the air, imbuing it with purpose, and then imagine patching the cells of the mule with my mana.

DM: You project a single, silent concept: Be still. The mule freezes. You reach out with your mind and take the raw, untamed energy from the air. It's a chaotic, roaring torrent, and the young body threatens to buckle under the strain. But you hold on, your Gemini core filtering the energy, imbuing it with the singular concept of wholeness.

You channel the energy into the wound. There is no gentle glow. Instead, a faint, colorless shimmer envelops the gash. The edges of the wound tremble and pull together with unnatural speed. When you pull your hand away, the open gash is gone. In its place is a raw, puckered scar. The wound is closed.

A wave of vertigo crashes over you; the effort has scraped the very bottom of your fledgling magical reserves. The mule, freed from its pain, looks at you not with terror, but with a placid, curious respect.

What do you do?

Player: I gather my strength and equip the mule with the saddle and other equipment. I untie the rope and gesture for it to follow me. The mule shall carry the bulk of the copper and bronze coins, as well as the provisions. I will carry the silver coins. I will traverse on foot and head to the heart of the barony.

DM: It takes several minutes for the strength to return to your limbs. The mule stands placidly as you equip it, organizing your possessions and loading the heavy coins and provisions into the saddlebags. You secure the silver on your own belt.

Turning your back on the ruined village, you begin to walk. The boy’s memories supply the route—a muddy track that winds east. That road leads south to Rochefort, the fortified town that serves as the seat of the local Baron. The soft squelch of your new boots and the steady, plodding hoofbeats of the mule behind you are the only sounds.

What do you do?

Player: I will now proceed on this journey. Roll the dice and determine what encounters I have, if any.

DM: The first day passes in a blur of lonely, rhythmic plodding. You make a cold camp as dusk settles and sleep fitfully. The second day dawns much the same.
Roll: 82 (Encounter: Direct Threat)

In the early afternoon, the road dips into a densely wooded copse. You instinctively halt as you hear the snap of a dry twig. From the shadows, three gaunt goblins emerge, armed with crude, rusty cleavers. They spread out, blocking the road, their black, beady eyes fixed first on the laden mule, then on you.

What do you do?

Player: I consider my tactical options. My most economical approach is to obtain a firing solution to incapacitate the goblins, aiming for the eye, neck, and crotch. I put the plan into motion. "Gemini, initiate automated combat sub-processes."

DM:

    Acknowledged. Combat sub-routines initiated. Optimal targeting solutions engaged.

Your perception shifts. The world is a tactical map. In a single, fluid motion, you pluck a throwing knife from your boot.
Roll: 91 (Critical Success)

The knife spins through the air, sinking to the hilt in the right eye socket of the goblin on the right. It crashes to the ground, twitching. One down.

The other two goblins freeze in shock before the largest roars and charges. The other advances more cautiously, trying to flank you. The charging goblin will be on you in three seconds.

What do you do?

Player: The charging goblin is exposed. Target the lower body, the crotch, or the mouth/neck region. Two throwing knives to guarantee incapacitation. Initiate.

DM:

    Acknowledging. Executing command.

Your body flows. Your left hand sweeps down, closing around the hilts of the remaining two knives.
Roll: 88 (High Success)

The first knife flies true, slamming into the charging goblin's throat. Blood fountains from the wound. Its momentum carries it forward, a dead thing still running.
Roll: 79 (Success)

The second knife leaves your hand a microsecond later, striking the goblin in the groin. It collapses into a boneless, twitching heap at your feet. Two down.

The last goblin freezes, its eyes wide with terror. It lets out a high-pitched squeal, drops its weapon and shield, and turns to flee into the woods.

What do you do?

Player: I increase my pace to get a running start, using the force of inertia to throw my axe, aiming for the back of the running goblin’s skull.

DM:

    Command confirmed. Calculating optimal trajectory for moving target...

You sprint, using your forward momentum as a force multiplier, and unleash the hand axe.
Roll: 89 (High Success)

The axe tumbles through the air, connecting with a solid, wet thud at the base of the goblin’s skull. It pitches forward into the mud, still. Three down. None left.

What do you do?

Player: I retrieve my weapons and wipe the smelly goblin blood off with fabric from their bodies. I search them for any possible loot and command the Gemini system to check if I gained any EXP from this fight.

DM: You retrieve your weapons, cleaning them on strips of filthy cloth from the goblins' loincloths. You then perform a quick search.
Roll: 65 (Modest Success)

The first two goblins have nothing but junk. The third has a small pouch containing:

    7 Copper Pieces

    A Silver Locket: Tarnished and dented, clearly of human make.

You then turn your attention inward.

    Analyzing esoteric energy absorption...

        Threats Neutralized: 3x Goblin Marauders (Unranked).

        Result: A significant influx of ambient esoteric energy has been absorbed and processed.

    Milestone Progression: 45%

    Conclusion: You have not yet reached the threshold for a full "Level Up," but you are nearly halfway there.

The grim task is complete. What do you do?

Player: I think to myself "Excellent. The EXP is good. This world is rich in esoteric resources." I continue my journey, wondering what I will encounter next.

DM: As you stow the tarnished locket, you continue on. The rest of the day passes without incident. As twilight begins to bleed across the sky, you reach a proper, stone-laid road. A weathered wooden signpost reads:

<-- Oakhaven (2 Leagues)
--> Rochefort (5 Leagues)

Oakhaven is a small hamlet. Rochefort is your goal. You have enough light left for another hour or two of travel. What do you do?

Player: I have enough currency to spend, and provisions in rural hamlets tend to be cheaper. I can also see if I can join a trade caravan to Rochefort. I'll head to Oakhaven.

DM: You adjust your course toward Oakhaven. By the time you see the first glimmer of lanterns, the world is draped in night. Oakhaven is circled by a crude wooden palisade. Two guards at the gate halt you. "State your business. Where do you come from, and where are you headed?"

What do you say?

Player: I report, “I am Arthur, son of Morgan. My father is a guard. My village was attacked by greenskins. I am the sole survivor.”

DM: The lead guard’s posture changes. The suspicion in his eyes melts away, replaced by a deep, weary sorrow. "Hollow Creek," he says, a statement of grim confirmation. "Gods... we heard the commotion on the wind two nights back." He jerks his head toward the open gate. "Get inside. There’s only one inn here, The Bent Nail. The elder, Master Willem, will want to speak with you come morning."

What do you do?

Player: I stable my mule, letting it feed and rest. I enter the inn and check the prices for a room and food. What's on the menu?

DM: You settle the mule in a small stable attached to the inn. You push open the heavy oak door. The common room is small and smoky. A portly, balding innkeeper looks up. "A room for the night is one bronze piece," he grumbles. "Stabling for the beast is another ten coppers. We’ve got a hot stew and fresh bread. That’ll be twenty coppers. What can I get for you, lad?"

What do you do?

Player: I speak with a tone that would suggest a background that isn’t humble, but with no disrespect. I request a room, stabling, and three portions of stew for myself.

DM: You meet the innkeeper’s gaze. "I require a room for the night and stabling for my mule," you state. "I will also have three portions of your stew." The innkeeper’s eyebrows climb his forehead. "Three portions, lad?" he asks. "That’ll be one bronze and fifty-five coppers. See the coin first."

What do you do?

Player: I pay with 160 copper coins and tell him to keep the change.

DM: You slide a hefty stack of 160 copper pieces across the bar. The innkeeper stares at the unusual payment, then scoops them up with a satisfied grunt. "Aye, well. Room’s upstairs. Number three. Name’s Elric. I’ll have young Bess bring your stew up directly."

What do you do next?

Player: I go to my room to rest. I wait for the waitress to come up with my stew. I give her 32 coppers and ask her to clean my clothes and boots for me.

DM: The room is small and spartan. A few minutes later, a young woman, Bess, enters with a tray bearing three large, steaming bowls of stew. As she turns to leave, you stop her and hold out thirty-two coppers. "Clean my clothes and boots. I want them ready by morning." Bess stares at the extravagant tip, her eyes wide with disbelief, before snatching the coins and your clothes and scurrying away. You eat all three bowls of the hot, savory stew. Fed and secure, the exhaustion of the past few days begins to press down on you.

What do you do?

Player: I engage the Gemini system to have a sub-process wake me up based on danger or at daybreak. My objective is to maximize deep sleep for cellular repair.

DM: You close your eyes and issue a series of silent, internal commands.

    Acknowledged. Initiating 'Sentinel Rest' sub-process.

        Auditory & Proximity Monitoring: Active.

        Biological Optimization: Active. Directing energy towards cellular repair.

        Wake-up Condition: [Danger Trigger] OR [First Light].
        Engaging low-power state. Conscious processes suspended.

There are no dreams, only a deep, silent, and profoundly efficient blackness. You are awakened by a silent, internal alert.

    Condition Met: [First Light]. Disengaging 'Sentinel Rest' protocol.

Your eyes open. The aches from the road are gone, your mind sharp and clear. A soft knock comes at the door. It's Bess, carrying your clothes and boots, now immaculately clean. "Will there be anything else, sir?" she asks.

What do you do?

Player: I say, "Good, prepare three portions of whatever meat dish you have, I will have breakfast." I hand another 50 copper coins to her.

DM: Bess gasps as you press another fifty coppers into her hand. For breakfast, this is a fortune. She practically sprints from the room, promising the best thick-smoked bacon they have. You rise and dress. A short while later, she returns with an enormous tray bearing three plates piled high with sizzling bacon and fried bread. You eat with the same methodical efficiency. When you are finished, the sun is higher in the sky. The guard's words from last night echo: "...the elder, Master Willem, will want to speak with you come morning."

What do you do?

Player: I head out of the inn fully dressed, placing my lower value coins on the mule along with the provisions, and head to the village elder’s place.

DM: You descend to the common room, where the innkeeper gives you a curt, respectful nod. You load your mule and lead it out into the hamlet. The people of Oakhaven are about their business, but there’s a nervous energy in the air. You easily find the elder’s house and knock. A man in his late sixties with sharp, intelligent eyes opens the door. "You are the boy from Hollow Creek," he says. "Come in." He gestures to a chair opposite his desk. "Sit. Tell me what happened."

Player: I report the matter factually, but add in filler words like "there were probably 20 dead goblins," "everybody is dead," and "the village elder was killed by a spear."

DM: You recount the events with a disturbing lack of emotion. "The goblins came at dawn, two days ago... a large warband... maybe a hundred? They overwhelmed the men quickly... everybody is dead. The village is gone. Burned to the ground. The elder was killed by a spear... The women and the children... they weren't among the bodies. The goblins took them."

Master Willem listens, his jaw tight. He leans forward, studying you. "A hundred..." he murmurs. "That is no mere scouting party. You did well to survive, son. Incredibly well. Tell me... how did you get away?"

Player: I look at the elder for a few seconds, as if blaming him for asking a painful question. I speak, this time with emotion, a crackle in my voice, moisture in my eyes: “My mother slapped me and pushed me into the manure. I hid there until it was over.”

DM: The effect on Master Willem is immediate and profound. He physically recoils, his shrewd look vanishing, replaced by horrified shame. "Enough, son," he says, his voice thick with emotion. "Forgive an old man’s foolish questions. Enough." He takes a deep breath, his suspicion completely erased. "What you’ve told me is invaluable. The Baron must be warned. Immediately. I am sending a rider to Rochefort at once. You said you were heading there yourself, didn't you?"

Player: I thank the elder for his kindness, but say I'd rather journey to Rochefort myself. I explain that my father had promised to take me to Bordeaux, to the Arcane Academy or the Church recruiting center, on my 15th birthday. I must get to Rochefort to continue that journey.

DM: Master Willem listens, his expression shifting from pity to a deep, profound respect. "A noble ambition, Arthur. A worthy one." He leans forward again. "But your path is dangerous. I am sending my best rider, a man named Thomas, to Rochefort. He is a veteran scout. He leaves within the hour. Travel with him. He will see you safely to the walls of Rochefort."

What do you do?

Player: I thank the elder for his generosity and accept. I ask if I am able to ride on the same horse as Thomas while my mule follows behind.

DM: You accept the offer. Master Willem shakes his head at your question. "Thomas’s mare is swift, but she’s not built to carry two. You’ll ride your own beast. Thomas will set a hard pace, but a healthy mule can keep it." He leads you to the main stable where you meet Thomas, a lean, wiry man in his late thirties with watchful, intelligent eyes. He gives you a short, sharp nod of acknowledgement. "We ride in ten minutes," he says, his voice low and gravelly. "Be ready."

What do you do?

Player: I look at my mule, questioning, "Gemini, how much weight can it carry comfortably? Combine my weight and the weight of my provisions and coins and verify."

DM:

    Query received. Analyzing total load capacity...

        Total Estimated Load: ~187 lbs / 85 kg.

        Mule Analysis: Comfortable long-distance carrying capacity is 200 lbs (90 kg).

    Conclusion: The current load is at 93.5% of maximum comfortable capacity. A hard pace will be taxing but is achievable.

The analysis is clear. You spend the next few minutes adjusting the load for better balance. Thomas observes your quiet competence with a flicker of professional acknowledgement. He swings into his saddle. "Time’s up," he says. "Let’s ride." You mount your mule, and the two of you ride out of Oakhaven, the gate closing behind you.

Player: Let's set out on the journey. Let me know if I roll an encounter or if the day passes and we need to take a break for the night.

DM: The journey with Thomas is a stark contrast to your lonely trek. He moves with a relentless purpose, rarely speaking, and frequently diverting onto game trails and hidden paths for cover.
Roll: 71 (Tense Situation, No Direct Encounter)

In the late afternoon, Thomas suddenly halts and slips from his saddle. He beckons you forward and points to the ground. There are dozens of fresh goblin tracks. In the distance, you can hear the faint sound of guttural chatter. He leads you into a dense cluster of oaks to hide. A few minutes later, a patrol of about fifteen goblins passes your position, never knowing you are there. "A splinter from the main warband," Thomas whispers. "They’re spreading out."

As dusk settles, Thomas leads you to a defensible, rocky overhang to make camp. "No fire," he states. "We eat cold and sleep in shifts."

What do you do?

Player: I take out my provisions and offer a portion to Thomas. I will be eating sausages and cheese. I will eat three portions as usual. If nothing else, I will engage my sentinel sleep.

DM: You offer Thomas a generous portion of your cheese and sausage, which he accepts with a grateful nod. After your meal, he takes the first watch. You issue your internal command.

    Acknowledged. Engaging low-power state. Conscious processes suspended.

You are awakened by a firm pressure on your shoulder. It's Thomas. "Your watch," he whispers. "Nothing to report." You take your position, and the hours pass in silent, watchful solitude.
Roll: 32 (No Event)

Your watch is uneventful. Just as dawn breaks, you wake Thomas. After a cold, quick breakfast, you are packed, mounted, and moving again. Rochefort is now less than a day’s ride away.

Player: On the way to Rochefort, I analyze the structure of my mule with the Gemini system. I ponder the possible ways I can improve its body structure, bone density, digestive system, and muscle structure. Let's look at the viable options on the way there.

DM: As you ride, you issue a silent command for a full diagnostic scan of the mule. A complex latticework of data overlays your vision.

    Analysis Commencing...

    Viable Augmentations:

        [Concept: Esoteric Myofibril Lamination]: Channeling mana into muscle tissue to induce a crystalline sub-layer along each myofibril, drastically increasing tensile strength.

        [Concept: Bio-Crystalline Matrix Infusion]: Altering the bone's calcium lattice with solidified mana, rendering them almost unbreakable at the cost of increased weight and caloric needs.

        [Concept: Symbiotic Flora Enhancement]: Hyper-evolving the gut biome with esoteric energy to extract nearly double the energy from the same amount of food.

        [Concept: Hemoglobin Optimization]: Subtly altering hemoglobin to increase oxygen-binding affinity, dramatically boosting stamina.

    Recommended Protocol: A staged approach is optimal, beginning with Flora Enhancement and Hemoglobin Optimization for the greatest immediate return on energy investment.

    Limitation Warning: All proposed augmentations require significant refined mana and prolonged, focused concentration. Not advisable in your current state or an unsecured environment.

Your concentration is broken by Thomas’s voice. "Something on your mind, lad? You’ve been staring at that mule’s backside for the better part of an hour."

Ahead, through a break in the trees, you can see cultivated fields. In the distance, rising above the plains, is the grey smudge of stone walls and the dark needle of a watchtower.

"We’re on the Baron’s lands now," Thomas says, a note of relief in his voice. "Another two hours, maybe less. We’ll be at the gates of Rochefort before midday."

Player: I reply "that's good news, thank you for your efforts, big brother." I then remark that I'm famished and some roast meat and eggs would be wonderful.

DM: You look up at the distant smudge of stone walls, a genuine sense of relief coloring your voice. "That’s good news," you say. "Thank you for your efforts, big brother."

For the first time on the journey, Thomas’s stoic mask cracks. A corner of his mouth twitches. "Hmph. Just Thomas is fine, lad," he grumbles, though there is no heat in it.

You let out a sigh. "I’m famished. Some roast meat and eggs would be wonderful right now."

At this, a genuine, small grin finally breaks through his weathered features. "Hah," he barks. "Now you’re talking sense. The sooner we get this message to the Baron, the sooner we eat."

The smudge on the horizon grows into high stone ramparts and sturdy watchtowers. You join a steady stream of travelers heading for the main gate. The town of Rochefort is before you.

Player: I enter the town gates with Thomas, wondering if I need to follow Thomas to the baron’s fort.

DM: The guards at the gate are professional soldiers. A grizzled sergeant recognizes Thomas. "Trouble," Thomas says, gesturing to you. "The warband from the Broken Hills hit Hollow Creek. Wiped it out. This boy is the only survivor. The message is for the Baron’s ears only."

The sergeant’s face darkens. He waves you through. You pass under the portcullis and into Rochefort. The change is immediate. The air is thick with the smells and sounds of a thousand people. The streets are narrow and crowded.

Thomas pulls his mare to a halt at a crossroads. One street leads uphill towards the Baron’s fortress. The other leads into the commercial heart of town.

"This is where we part ways, Arthur," he says. "I’m heading up to the keep. The Baron will want to hear your testimony firsthand. Or... you can find yourself an inn. Get that meal. No one would blame you."

The choice is yours. Go with him to the seat of power or melt into the anonymity of the town.

What do you do?

Player: I smile and thank Thomas. I reply politely that I’d like to have that peace now. I head for the inn and rest the mule. Heading in, I inspect the prices and the scene.

DM: A small, genuine smile touches your lips. "Thank you, Thomas," you say. "But I think I’d like to have that peace now."

Thomas gives a slow, understanding nod. "Can’t say I blame you. Go to The Salty Boar. Two streets down, on the right. Rough place, but the ale is strong, the food is hot, and they don’t ask too many questions." With a final, "Be safe, Arthur," he turns his mare and rides towards the keep.

You find the inn easily, a large, two-story timber building. You lead your mule to the stables, paying a few coppers to the stable hand. The common room of The Salty Boar is large, smoky, and packed with guards, mercenaries, and merchants. A stout, middle-aged woman with iron-grey hair commands the space behind the bar. The price board lists prices higher than in Oakhaven.

    --- The Salty Boar ---

        Room (per night): 2 bp

        Stabling (with feed): 25 cp

        The Boar’s Feast (Roast Pork, Eggs, Fried Bread): 50 cp

You are just another face in the crowd. What do you do?

Player: I give a slight polite bow, and request in a concise manner that I’d like to have a room, stabling, and two portions of the boar’s feast.

DM: You find a clear space at the bar. The formidable woman turns her sharp, assessing gaze on you. You give a slight, formal bow. "I require a room for the night, stabling for my mule, and two portions of the Boar's Feast, if you please."

The woman’s eyebrows tighten. "Is that so?" she says, her voice like gravel. She slaps a heavy iron key on the bar. "The room is three silver pieces. The food is one silver. Stabling is twenty-five coppers. That’ll be four silver and twenty-five coppers, paid in advance." She crosses her arms, waiting.

What do you do?

Player: I pay her the correct amount, using copper and bronze coins where possible. Did she just try to cheat me? The room costs 2 bronze coins, and the food is 1 bronze coin (50 coppers each).

DM:

    Price Discrepancy Detected.
    Listed Price: 3 Bronze, 25 Copper.
    Quoted Price: 4 Silver, 25 Copper.
    Conclusion: High probability of intentional deception.

You don’t argue. You simply place three bronze pieces on the sticky bar top, then carefully count out a pile of twenty-five copper pieces beside them. "Three bronze, twenty-five coppers," you state, your voice perfectly even.

A slow, grudging smirk spreads across the woman’s face. It holds a sliver of respect. "Hah," she grunts. "Sharp eyes on this one." She sweeps the coins off the bar. "OY! GET THE NEW LAD HIS FEAST! TWO OF 'EM!" She shoves the key towards you. "Room is number four. Upstairs, end of the hall on the left."

Where do you go?

Player: I head up to the room and organize my inventory. How much coin and provisions do I have left? I inspect as I wait for my feast.

DM: You go up to your room, which is a clear upgrade from Oakhaven. You retrieve your saddlebags from the stable and take stock.

Currency Inventory:

    Silver: 23 pieces (sp)

    Bronze: 148 pieces (bp)

    Copper: 125 pieces (cp)

Provisions Inventory:

    Sausages: About half the original string remains.

    Cheese: The majority of the wheel is still there.

    Dried Apples: Ten remain.

    Potatoes: The sack is untouched.

    Waterskin: Full.

A sharp rap on the door announces your meal: two large platters piled high with thick slices of roasted pork, four perfectly fried eggs, and several slabs of dark bread. You are alone in your secure room with your possessions organized and a mountain of hot, savory food before you.

What do you do?

Player: I call out to the boy and offer him 25 coppers to clean my shoes and clothes as I feast and enjoy my sentinel sleep.

DM: Just as the delivery boy is about to leave, you call out, "Wait." You hold out twenty-five coppers. "My boots and clothes. Clean them. Have them ready by morning." The boy’s eyes go wide at the absurdly generous tip. "Y-yes, sir! Of course, sir!" he stammers, grabbing the coins.

You devour both portions of the magnificent feast. When you are finished, you strip down, leaving your clothes for the boy, and slide into the comfortable bed.

    Acknowledged. Engaging enhanced recovery protocols. Sweet dreams.
    The world fades into a familiar, productive blackness.

Player: I wake up again, and head down at daybreak for 3 portions of a meat item. I'm guessing they cost 25 coppers each, so I should have 25 coppers left. I ask the boy for the direction to the merchant’s square.

DM:

    Condition Met: [First Light]. Disengaging 'Sentinel Rest' protocol. Recovery cycle complete. All systems optimal.

You rise feeling profoundly restored. The delivery boy, Pip, arrives with your impeccably clean clothes. You dress and head downstairs. The formidable innkeeper, Megara, gives you a curt nod. You order three portions of the morning's fried sausages, confirming the price of 25 coppers a plate. You pay the seventy-five coppers, leaving you with 25 coppers as calculated. Pip gives you clear directions to the merchant's square. You stand, fully equipped and ready for the day.

What do you do?

Player: I pay attention to the instructions. Let's head to the blacksmith’s store first. I’d like to review the weapons on sale.

DM: Following the rhythmic clang-clang-clang of a hammer, you arrive at a large, soot-stained forge. This is no village smithy; it is a weaponsmith. A sturdy rack displays soldier-grade weapons: arming swords, battle axes, daggers, and more. The master blacksmith, a massive, barrel-chested man, finishes his work and turns to you. "See something you like, lad?" he asks, his voice a low, powerful rumble.

Player: I'm interested in a round shield that I can carry on my back, a set of 6 daggers suitable to be used as thrown weapons, a sword, and a one-handed axe. I order Gemini to identify the most suitable options to prepare for the widest array of tactical options.

DM:

    Analysis Complete. Optimal Loadout Identified:

        Shield: A small, circular shield with a back strap.

        Throwing Knives: Six longer, heavier, spine-weighted daggers.

        Sword: A "bastard" or hand-and-a-half sword with an extended grip.

        Axe: A "bearded" axe with a hooked blade.

You point to the specific items. The blacksmith’s eyebrows rise in surprise at your professional selections. "A versatile kit," he rumbles. "You have a good eye, lad." He gathers the items. "This is fine work. The whole set will cost you fifty silver pieces. Not a bronze less."

Player: Hmm.. that is a little pricey. I ask what can I get with 20 silvers?

DM: "That is a fair price," you say, "Unfortunately, it is beyond my current means. What can I get for twenty silver?"

The blacksmith considers. "For twenty silver, I can give you a choice. Option one: a standard arming sword and the bearded axe. Option two: you keep the sword you have, and I give you the round shield and the full set of six throwing knives."

What do you do?

Player: I think the shield and throwing knives will put me in a good position as I already have a sword and axe. I ask if I’m allowed to use the grinding stone to sharpen my current weapons. And if payment can be the three throwing knives that I don’t want anymore.

DM: "I will take the second option," you state. "The shield and the six throwing knives." You then offer to trade your three current throwing knives for the use of his grinding wheel. The blacksmith inspects your knives and agrees. "It's a deal."

You pay the twenty silver. You spend the next hour honing your old sword and axe to a razor's edge. When you are finished, you have spent nearly all your silver, but you have transformed yourself into a versatile, comprehensively equipped warrior.

What do you do?

Player: I take a look at the merchant’s square casually. I keep an eye out and ask the Gemini system to scan for undervalued items.

DM: You begin a slow, methodical circuit of the bustling merchant's square.

    Passive Scan Engaged... Anomaly Detected.

        Location: Stall of a "curiosity" merchant.

        Target Item: A small, unassuming whetstone being used as a paperweight.

        Analysis: The item is not slate or sandstone, but meteoric iron alloyed with an unknown crystalline substance. It emits a faint, complex esoteric energy signature.

        Hypothesis: This is a low-tier magical artifact that temporarily imbues a blade with a charge of energy when used for sharpening.

        Conclusion: The whetstone is of significant potential value.

The old man running the stall cracks an eye open. "See something ya fancy, young sir?" he rasps.

Player: I ask: "Senior, may I know if I can purchase this strange-looking whetstone for 20 coppers?"

DM: The old man’s eye squints. He sees a fastidious warrior who appreciates a good sharpening stone. "That old thing?" he rasps. "Tell you what. Make it twenty-five, and it’s yours."

Player: I furrow my brows and stand there for 7 seconds before offering a wry smile and nod and say "the price of a fine stew for a fine stone, a fair trade."

DM: You let the silence stretch before a wry smile spreads across your face. "The price of a fine stew for a fine stone. A fair trade." You pay him the twenty-five coppers. He hands you the whetstone. It feels surprisingly heavy and cool, with a faint, imperceptible vibration humming within it. You have traded the last of your pocket change for an item of incalculable potential.

Player: Don’t I still have 148 bronze and 3 silvers?

DM: You are absolutely correct. My apologies. Let’s recalibrate.

    Silver: 3 Pieces remaining.

    Bronze: 148 Pieces remaining.

    Copper: 217 Pieces remaining.
    You are not broke. You stand in the merchant’s square, a powerful warrior with a solid financial cushion. What is your next objective?

Player: Alright. For esoteric items of such nature, let's use a simplified naming style like in video games. How about item(+1)? The + quality would denote the level of magic strength.

DM: Excellent. That is a highly logical system.

    (+1) - Copper Tier

    (+2) - Bronze Tier

    (+3) - Silver Tier

    (+4) - Gold Tier

    Unique/Artifact

    Item Acquired: Meteoric Whetstone (+1)
    Tier: Copper
    Effect: When used to sharpen a non-magical weapon, it temporarily imbues the blade with a [Keen Edge +1] property, granting a minor bonus to its cutting and piercing effectiveness. The enchantment fades after about an hour of active combat.

What is your next objective?

Player: I head over to check the adventurer’s guild for quests. I weigh my options on whether I can just pay to join a caravan to Bordeaux or if there are any quests that I can take on and get an adventurer identification card that can make me earn money as a caravan guard on the way to Bordeaux.

DM: You find the Adventurer's Guild, a quiet, serious place of business. The heart of the room is a massive Quest Board. You scan the "Escort Duty" section.

    Contract: Caravan Guard Needed
    Client: Aldric’s Fine Wools
    Destination: The city of Veridia (on the main road to Bordeaux).
    Pay: 1 Silver Piece per week (2 sp total), plus rations.
    Requirements: Must possess a Copper Rank Adventurer’s License.

You approach the registrar, Kaelen. "I wish to inquire about obtaining a Copper Rank Adventurer’s License."
"Registration requires two things," he says. "First, the processing fee: one silver piece. Second, a Ranking Assessment. You have to prove you can handle yourself."

What do you do?

Player: I think the rewards for copper and unranked quests are a rip-off. I mentally note down the Goblin den quest and the Blacktusk boar quest with Gemini. I have the location; I can finish the quest and come back later and ask if I can just be directly promoted.

DM:

    Financial Analysis: Grossly inefficient. The guild structure is a predatory system.

You give the registrar a polite smile. "Thank you for the information. I will consider it." You turn back to the board and your mind becomes a camera.

    Data Recorded.

        Contract 1: Clear the Goblin Den in the Old Quarry. Reward: 40 Silver Pieces.

        Contract 2: Hunt the Blacktusk Boar. Reward: 35 Silver Pieces.

The path is clear. Why pay a fee to prove you are capable, when you can simply perform a task that is self-evident proof? You walk out of the Guild. One quest is a war of attrition, the other a climactic duel.

What do you do?

Player: The Blacktusk boar, let's do that. I lead my mule out of town and set off towards the eastern farmlands. If there are no encounters until sundown, I will attempt to improve on my mule as recommended.

DM: The decision is made. You retrieve your mule and head for the east gate. The journey is uneventful. As the sun begins to set, you find yourself in the boar’s territory. You make a cold, hidden camp. The time is right.

    Acknowledged. Initiating esoteric bio-modification protocol. Proceed with caution.

This is not brute force; this is surgery. You carefully draw a thin, steady stream of refined mana. First, you guide it into the mule’s bloodstream, subtly reinforcing the hemoglobin molecules to increase oxygen-binding affinity. Next, you project the mana into its gut, creating the perfect environment for the cellulose-digesting bacteria to hyper-evolve. The process is intensely draining. When you are finished, you slump back, exhausted. The mule lets out a low, rumbling sigh. The changes are invisible, but they are real.

Player: Let's wake up in the morning and verify if stage 1 of the modification is complete. If yes, I will name the mule "Ford Bronco."

DM:

    Diagnostic Complete.

        Cardiovascular System: Hemoglobin oxygen-binding affinity increased by 8.2%. Success.

        Digestive System: Symbiotic gut flora has successfully mutated. Success.
        Conclusion: Phase One augmentations are stable and successful.

It worked. You have fundamentally upgraded the mule's internal engine. You run a hand along its dusty neck. "I will call you Ford Bronco." The mule, now Ford Bronco, nudges your hand as if in acknowledgement. You set off deeper into the meadows, your eyes scanning the ground. The hunt has begun.

Player: I explore the reported sighting area in a grid pattern, using the Gemini system's ability to analyze and extrapolate the most possible location. Do I find it?

DM:

    Acknowledged. Commencing topographical and behavioral analysis...
    Actionable Intelligence: A small creek runs through the eastern farmlands. Three large, dense copses of trees line this creek. These are the prime locations.

You have your plan. You approach the creek downwind. The first two copses are empty. As you near the third, you hear a low, guttural snorting and the crack of splintering wood. You have found it.

You dismount, tethering Ford Bronco, and draw your bastard sword. You creep to the edge of the trees and peer through the briars. In a small clearing, a beast of monstrous proportions, the size of a small bull, is tearing apart a deer carcass. Its tusks are not curved ivory, but thick, straight, jet-black spikes of obsidian. This is the Blacktusk Boar. It has not seen you.

What do you do?

Player: I recall my most reliable arsenal of simple magics: Execute scripts: vibration softening (sound removal), micro wind cloak (to prevent smells from leaking), and remaining stealth sub-processes. Objective: stab the sword into the boar’s anus and use the axe to chop off its balls. Strike at a leg tendon if possible.

DM:

    Acknowledged. Executing multi-layered stealth package...

You are now a ghost. You flow across the thirty feet of open ground, a silent, grey shadow. The boar remains completely unaware.
Roll: 12 (Critical Success)

The razor-sharp point of your sword finds its mark with surgical, horrifying precision. You drive the blade deep into its rear. A sound of pure, agonized shock rips from the monster’s throat. You release the sword, leaving it buried, and your hand is already pulling the bearded axe free.
Roll: 35 (High Success)

The axe swings in a vicious arc, severing the boar’s testicles in a single, brutal blow. The monster’s squeal rises to a shriek of pure torment. It is crippled, disemboweled, castrated, and dying. But it is not yet dead. It thrashes on the ground, a mountain of dying, hate-filled muscle.

What do you do?

Player: It is in too much pain to move. I continue to circle around its back, never allowing it to see me. Gemini is able to map the monster’s cone of vision perfectly, and I bide my time to wait for an opportunity to slash at its soft belly.

DM:

    Acknowledged. Tracking target’s movements...

You are a rock in this storm, circling, always outside the sweeping arcs of its deadly tusks. You wait as the monster spends the last of its strength. In a final, desperate attempt to rise, the boar heaves its massive torso up, exposing its soft, unprotected underbelly.

    Optimal Strike Window Detected.
    Roll: 7 (Overwhelming Success)

The bearded axe slices across the beast’s exposed belly, opening a massive, gaping wound. A final, shuddering groan escapes its lungs. The Blacktusk Boar is dead.

What do you do?

Player: I command in my mind for Gemini to identify the best way to skin and butcher this beast. In the meantime, I also breathe in deep, as if absorbing any remnant mana from the monster perishing. I wonder if I leveled up.

DM: You take a deep, deliberate breath, drawing in the esoteric resonance left behind by the death of a powerful creature.

    Analysis Complete.

        Threat Neutralized: 1x Blacktusk Boar (Bronze Tier Monster).

        Result: A massive influx of high-quality esoteric energy has been absorbed. The metaphysical threshold has been crossed.

    MILESTONE ACHIEVED: LEVEL 2

        Attribute Points Gained: 6

        Current Unassigned Points: 6

You have leveled up.

    Acknowledged. Projecting anatomical overlay...

Following the perfect butcher’s diagram in your mind’s eye, you set to work. After an hour of hard, bloody work, you have:

    The Blacktusk Boar’s Head: The proof of your kill.

    One Large Blacktusk Hide: A valuable raw material.

    Approx. 400 lbs of Prime Boar Meat: Far more than you can carry.

    The Heart and Liver: For immediate consumption.

You now face a logistical problem. What do you do?

Player: I assign 6 points directly into my strength, passing the important threshold of 10 and into 11, granting me a qualitative increase in strength. Next, I start a small campfire and sterilize my daggers. I make pork skewers with the heart, liver, and delicious pork belly with potatoes.

DM:

    Acknowledged. Allocating 6 points to STR.
    Strength: 5 -> 11
    Threshold Crossed: 10 (Copper Tier).

You feel it instantly. A deep, thrumming power awakens in your muscles and bones. You are no longer just a boy with a sharp mind; you are a physically capable warrior.

You gather dry wood and start a small campfire. You sterilize your new throwing knives in the flames and use them as skewers for the rich organ meats, fatty pork belly, and potatoes. You roast them over the fire, a magnificent, savory aroma filling the air. You eat your fill, the hot, perfectly cooked meat a feast of unparalleled quality, providing the raw materials for your body to rebuild itself stronger.

What is your plan for the bounty and the spoils?

Player: I observe my body first. I should have obvious muscles now. The pork must have been converted into muscles and layered with mana. Excellent. I use my remaining mana to improve on Ford Bronco before I finally rest for the night.

DM: You look down at your arms and torso. The difference is visible. Where there was a lean boy, there is now the clear, defined musculature of a young athlete.

    Acknowledged. Initiating focused bio-modification. Warning: Mental energy reserves are at 48%.

You place a hand on Ford Bronco’s shoulder. You focus a thread of refined mana with surgical precision on the large locomotive muscle groups, "painting" the individual fibers with a laminating layer of solidified, reinforcing energy. The process is still draining, but far less so than before. Ford Bronco shudders. The muscles under your hand feel harder, denser, like tightly wound cables of steel. You are both stronger now.

Player: I wake up in the morning starving again. I cook up another 5 portions of meat, then review the weight of everything and how Ford Bronco can carry it if I am on foot, also hauling.

DM: You awaken at first light, an overwhelming hunger your first sensation. You consume another five portions of the rich boar meat.

    Analysis in progress...

        Recalculated Maximum Comfortable Load Capacity: 200 lbs -> 240 lbs (approx. 109 kg).

        Total Estimated Load (All priority items + meat): 277 lbs / 126 kg.
        Conclusion: The load is 15% over the maximum comfortable limit.
        Recommendation: Reduce the amount of meat. Transporting 60 lbs would bring the total load to a manageable 237 lbs.

The data is clear. You lash the monstrous head and the heavy hide to the pack saddle. You then pack about 60 pounds of the best cuts of meat. The load is immense, but Ford Bronco’s reinforced muscles hold steady. You take the lead rope in hand. You will walk.

Player: I take the most efficient path back to the town, avoiding all muddy spots that cause additional fatigue where possible.

DM:

    Acknowledged. Calculating optimal route...

A shimmering, green line overlays your vision of the landscape. The journey back is a grueling exercise in patience and endurance. Your enhanced strength is crucial, helping to push and steady the massive load.
Roll: 41 (No Event)

Your return is uneventful. It is late afternoon when Rochefort’s walls appear on the horizon. The reaction at the gate is immediate. The guards, who saw you leave as a boy, now see a warrior returning, splattered with dried blood, leading a mule straining under the weight of a monstrous, tusked head. A crowd gathers. The gate sergeant’s eyes go wide. "By the gods... The Blacktusk... You actually did it." The news spreads like wildfire. Your anonymity in Rochefort is irrevocably over.

Player: I hurriedly go to the butcher and ask to sell the meats. Then I head to the guild to hand in the proof of kill. Let's see what unfolds and how much I receive from the butcher.

DM: You find the nearest butcher, a stout man with a bloody apron. His jaw drops at the sight of the prime, dark meat. "This is Blacktusk meat, isn’t it?" he says in awe. "I’ll give you ten silver pieces for the lot."
Roll: 82 (Success with a Bonus)

Just as you are about to accept, a well-dressed man with the seal of the Baron’s steward steps forward. "I will take half of that meat myself," he says. "The Baron will wish to taste the beast." He turns to you. "The Baron’s kitchen will pay you a premium." He tells the butcher to pay you fifteen silver, the Baron’s household covering the difference.

With 18 silver pieces now in your pouch, you lead Ford Bronco to the Adventurer’s Guild. The hall falls silent as you enter. You heave the monstrous, bloody head of the Blacktusk Boar onto the polished counter with a wet, heavy thud. You look the registrar, Kaelen, directly in the eye. "I believe," you say, your voice calm and quiet, "this is worth a Bronze-tier license. And the reward, of course."

Player: I don’t ask for the bronze tier license, I ask for the copper license. I know that my stats are not high enough for a bronze tier and I will only be asking for trouble by claiming to be strong without the skill to back it up. I also collect my silver coin reward.

DM: "However," you continue smoothly, "I am new to these lands. A Copper license will suffice for now." Your calculated humility disarms Kaelen completely. "A Copper license..." he repeats, dazed. "Yes. Of course." He waives the one-silver assessment fee and issues you a Copper Rank license and token. "Thirty-five silver pieces for the completion of the Blacktusk Boar contract," he says, pushing a heavy stack of coins towards you. You now have 53 silver pieces. "Welcome to the Guild, Arthur."

Player: I thank Kaelen with a small nod and a polite “Thank you.” I ask him if he could get rid of the boar head for me? I don’t need it and I’d rather take silver. My next order of business is to head to the blacksmith and get the improved axe and sword. I also check out the light armors on sale.

DM: "I have no further use for this," you state. "Could the Guild dispose of it for me?" Kaelen appraises the obsidian tusks. "The Guild’s standard finder’s fee is thirty percent. I’ll give you ten silver for it, flat rate." "Deal," you say instantly. You now have 63 silver.

You return to the blacksmith’s forge. Borin, the master smith, grins. "Heard a rumor a boy killed the Blacktusk." "The gear was instrumental," you reply. "I wish to purchase the hand-and-a-half sword and the bearded axe." You pay him the forty silver. "I also require armor. Something light."

Borin shows you three options:

    Studded leather: Cheap, serviceable. 20 silver.

    Mail shirt: Heavier, better protection. 50 silver.

    Coat of plates: His own design. Flexible leather with steel plates over vitals. The finest light armor he makes. 80 silver.

What do you do?

Player: I think I can only afford the studded leather set. How much money do I have left after buying?

DM:

    Remaining Silver: 63 - 60 (40 for weapons, 20 for armor) = 3 Silver Pieces.

"I will take the studded leather," you say. "A practical choice," Borin grunts. He helps you fit the armor. You are now a fully equipped, professional adventurer. You then present the Blacktusk Hide. "I have this. Prime quality. Interested?"

Borin’s expert eyes examine it. "Now this... this is a prize. I could make a masterwork suit of armor from this. I’ll give you twenty-five silver for it, straight up."

What do you do?

Player: I offer to shake his hand "good trade." I accept the deal and ask if there is a market for slaves.

DM: You shake his hand. "Good trade." He counts out another twenty-five silver pieces, refilling your pouch to a healthy twenty-eight. "Is there a market for slaves in this town?" you ask, your voice chillingly practical.

The warmth vanishes from Borin’s demeanor. The forge falls silent. "What did you say?" he asks, his voice a low, dangerous rumble. In the lands of the Divine Covenant, slavery is the ultimate taboo.

What do you do?

Player: I look at Borin, my eyes furrowing. I clarify: My father often calls the beastmen of the south slaves. He says that they do all the hard work for cheap and they steal the jobs of men who can only use their bodies to work. Is there a misunderstanding?

DM: You adopt an expression of genuine, profound confusion. The tension breaks. Borin’s hard expression softens. "Gods, lad. A misunderstanding, aye. A big one." He explains, "Never use that word here again. ‘Slave’. It’s a filthy word. The buying and selling of sentient beings is the highest crime." He clarifies that while Beastmen sometimes work for low wages in the capital, they are free folk, not property, and you won't find any in Rochefort. "You want to hire labor, you go to the town square and hire a man. And you pay him a fair day’s wage. Understand?"

Player: I give a sigh, and say: "So that's what he meant, I see. Thank you for the lesson, sir. I will watch my mouth from now on." I leave the blacksmith store and head to the market to look for provisions. I also check out the caravan guard quests to Bordeaux, wondering if provisions are provided for the trip.

DM: "Thank you for the lesson, sir," you say sincerely. You leave the forge, the cultural lesson more valuable than any weapon. You stock up on travel rations and other necessities in the merchant's square.

You return to the Adventurer's Guild. The atmosphere is different; people watch you with awe and respect. You are Arthur, the Boar-Slayer. You find the caravan contract on the board.

    Pay: 1 Silver Piece per week (2 sp total), plus rations.

The preservation of your own resources is a significant hidden benefit. You approach Kaelen. "I wish to sign on to the Aldric’s Fine Wools caravan," you state, placing your copper token on the counter. He verifies your license. "You’re the third guard hired. Be at the south gate at dawn, three days from now. Don’t be late."

You have three days in Rochefort before your journey begins. What is your plan?

Player: Three days huh. I head out of town with Ford Bronco, towards the goblin den. Do I reach there before the end of the day? Are there any encounters?

DM: Three days is a long time to remain idle. The goblin den contract is still open, its forty-silver reward a tantalizing prize. You lead Ford Bronco back out through the east gate. The landscape quickly changes from orderly fields to rugged, untamed wilderness. The journey is roughly fifteen miles, and you make excellent time.
Roll: 89 (Encounter: Ambush)

It happens late in the afternoon in a narrow pass between two steep, rocky hills.

    Scanning... WARNING! Multiple hostiles detected. Ambush positions identified on the ridges above. 10+ individuals. Snipers present.

You get the warning a split second before a crudely fletched arrow shatters against the rock face where your head just was. You roll behind a large boulder, pulling Ford Bronco into cover. High on the ridges, at least a dozen goblin archers rain arrows down on your position. Another group of goblins armed with spears and cleavers appears at both ends of the pass, blocking your escape. You are trapped in a kill box. From the ridge above, a larger goblin in a wolf-skull helmet lets out a triumphant, cackling shriek.

What do you do?

Player: I have 6 throwing daggers. I recall the highest priority 6 targets. Breathing controlled. Activate script, airflow control, projectile trajectory, script 后羿 execute.

DM:

    Acknowledged. 'Houyi' protocol engaged. Targeting solutions acquired for six primary threats...

You rise from your crouch and your arm becomes a piston. Six times, your wrist snaps forward. Six dark, leaf-shaped blades fly straight and true.
Rolls: 96, 88, 91, 85, 93, 89. (All Hits, one Critical)

The result on the ridges is catastrophic. The leader in the wolf-skull helmet is taken in the open mouth and collapses, dead before he hits the ground. Five other archers fall, struck in the eye, throat, or chest. In three seconds, the command structure of the ambush is annihilated. The rain of arrows stops. The advancing warriors freeze, their confidence shattered. You stand in the center of the kill box, your hand now on the hilt of your bastard sword.

What do you do?

Player: I arm myself with my shield and axe. My sword, I leave behind. I charge out under the cover of my shield and engage the closest goblin with a shield crash.

DM: Your movements are a single, fluid, terrifying sequence. You unsling your round shield and draw your bearded axe. With a guttural, inhuman roar, you charge. The closest group of warriors breaks into a panicked mob. You lower your shoulder, brace your shield, and hit the goblin in your path like a battering ram.
Roll: 92 (Critical Success)

The impact is catastrophic. The goblin’s shield disintegrates. The full force of your charge launches it backwards into two goblins directly behind it. They go down like bowling pins. You have utterly shattered their frontline. Your axe is raised. Their fear is a palpable scent in the air.

What do you do?

Player: I fight with the methodical discipline of my original life on earth as a trained naval diver. Chop, Crash, Chop, Crash.

DM: The chaos means nothing to you. Isolate. Target. Neutralize. Repeat. You are a whirlwind of controlled violence. CRASH. You shove a goblin off-balance. CHOP. The axe cleaves its skull. CRASH. You slam your shield into another's face. CHOP. The axe bites into its exposed neck. In less than a minute, the entire southern contingent is a ruin of broken bodies. The last two drop their weapons and flee. The northern group, watching in utter disbelief, breaks and runs with a collective shriek of terror. The battle is over.

Player: I collect my knives and my weapons, clean them. I don't suppose the leader is the chieftain, right? What is the probability of that, Gemini?

DM: You retrieve and clean your weapons.

    Conclusion: The probability that the slain leader was the main quarry chieftain is low. Estimated at approximately 15%. It is far more likely (85% probability) that he was a high-ranking lieutenant or warboss.

The analysis is clear. Your work here is not yet done.

Player: That is fine. I can see just as well in the dark due to the existence of night vision with Gemini’s sensory capabilities. I won't say the same for the goblins though. I snicker to myself. I chop off the ambush leader’s head and go on my merry way to the destination with Ford Bronco.

DM: A wry, cold snicker escapes your lips. You sever the warboss's head, wolf-skull helmet and all, and lash it to Ford Bronco's saddle. You continue your journey on foot. As the world falls into profound darkness, you engage your full-spectrum sensory overlay. You navigate the treacherous path with unnatural confidence. Finally, you reach the quarry. From the chasm below, you can see the flickering glow of campfires and hear the guttural laughter of the goblin den. They do not know you are here.

What do you do?

Player: I tie a very loose knot on Ford Bronco to a tree so that it may escape if targeted. Then I scan the quarry to see if I can spot the chieftain.

DM: You secure Ford Bronco with a slipknot and return to the lip of the chasm.

    Acknowledged. Commencing multi-spectrum analysis...
    Target Identified: At the back of the quarry, in front of the largest cave, a goblin of unusual size sits on a crude throne. He wears a rusty iron crown and has a polished, high-quality longsword strapped to his back. Beside his throne is a banner bearing a bloody wolf’s skull—the same symbol as the warboss's helmet.
    Conclusion: This is the Chieftain. Probability: 98%.

You have found your target. He is in the most heavily populated, brightly lit, and well-defended part of the entire den.

Player: A goblin that knows how to command goblins to capture human mates to reproduce... that is no normal goblin, that is a goblin whose soul belongs to a transmigrator. Haha! A wretched existence. I pace around the camp as I look for possible points of entry.

DM: The data points connect. This is not a goblin. This is a player. This changes everything. Your reconnaissance takes on a new urgency.

    Re-analysis Commenced. Applying strategic intelligence filter...
    Structural Anomaly Detected. Potential Infiltration Point Identified.

        Location: High on the western quarry wall, 70 feet directly above the chieftain’s cave.

        Description: A dark, vertical fissure in the rock face, a natural chimney or ventilation shaft connected to the cave system below.

        Challenge: Reaching it would require a difficult and dangerous climb.

You have found a back door.

Player: Negative. I refuse. This is a quarry, so there is only 1 major entrance. I command Gemini to place a tracker on this... transmigrator goblin’s mana signature. My plan is this: I will wait out here and destroy any raid parties heading out.

DM: You instantly discard the high-risk infiltration plan for one of cold, predatory patience.

    Acknowledged. Mana signature isolated and locked. Tracking engaged.

You retreat from the quarry’s edge and find a high, defensible position overlooking the single cart track that serves as the entrance and exit. You are laying siege, not to the walls, but to their ability to project power. You will bleed them, one party at a time. The first watch begins.

Player: Begin sentinel protocol. New temporary condition: Any goblin crossing that entrance threshold from inside to outside.

DM:

    New Alert Condition set and prioritized. Engaging 'Sentinel Vigil' protocol.

Just before dawn, the alert flashes.

    ALERT! CONDITION MET. MULTIPLE TARGETS (APPROX. 15) CROSSING EXIT THRESHOLD. SIGNATURE: GOBLINOID RAIDING PARTY.

You are instantly awake. A party of about fifteen goblins is moving in a stealthy, single-file line up the cart track. They are completely oblivious to your presence.

What do you do?

Player: Again, 6 throwing knives for 6 high value targets. Shield crash, chop, crash chop, until it is done.

DM:

    Acknowledged. Targeting solutions acquired.

You target the six rearmost goblins. Six heavy blades whisper through the pre-dawn gloom.
Rolls: 91, 84, 95, 88, 90, 92. (All Critical Successes)

One by one, the last six members of the raiding party drop silently to the ground. The lead goblins halt, turning in confusion. You are already moving, leaping from your perch to land on the path behind them, cutting off their retreat. Shield up. Axe out. You charge. The result is not a battle. It is an extermination. The fight lasts less than a minute. You have just completely, and silently, annihilated the den’s first raiding party of the day.

Player: I head back to my original spot, enjoy a meal and resume my sleep. I don’t eat too large a meal as it will make me slow. I digest my gains and check if I have leveled up.

DM: You retreat to your hidden perch and eat a modest breakfast of rations.

    Analysis Complete.

        Threats Neutralized: 15x Goblin Raiders (Unranked).

        Milestone Progression (Level 2): 22%
        Conclusion: You have not achieved a new level. Quality of the kill matters more than quantity.

You settle back into your concealed position and resume your 'Sentinel Vigil'.

Player: At daybreak, I focus on active absorption of mana. Once my mana caps out, I spend exactly half on improving Ford Bronco’s body. Then I go back to actively absorbing mana again. I keep my body in peak condition with small frequent meals and wait for the next movement from the goblin den.

DM: Your day unfolds in a rhythm of methodical self-improvement. You enter a meditative trance, drawing in ambient energy until your mana pool is full. You then expend half of it on Ford Bronco, continuing the Esoteric Myofibril Lamination on his forelegs and torso. You return to your meditation, refueling your mind.
Roll: 55 (No Event)

The day passes in watchful silence. The goblins, spooked by the failure of their dawn raid to return, do not emerge.

Player: I repeat the same process. Do they come out again tonight?

DM: The sun sets. The hours crawl by. Midnight passes. Then, the alert flashes.

    ALERT! CONDITION MET. MULTIPLE TARGETS (APPROX. 20) CROSSING EXIT THRESHOLD. HEAVIER SIGNATURES DETECTED.

This party is larger, and includes four bulky hobgoblins. The chieftain has sent a stronger force.

    Acknowledged. Heavy targets prioritized. Solutions acquired.

You rise. Your arm becomes a blur. Six blades hiss through the night.
Rolls: 98, 93, 89, 95, 99, 91. (All Critical Successes)

The four hobgoblins and two goblin lieutenants are eliminated in the first three seconds. Before the remaining fourteen can process it, you charge down the slope. It is a slaughter. When it is over, you stand amid twenty fresh corpses.

    Analysis Complete.

        Threats Neutralized: 20x Goblinoids (16x Unranked, 4x Copper Tier Hobgoblins).

        Milestone Progression (Level 2): 51%

The den has now lost thirty-five members in less than twenty-four hours, and they still have no idea how or why.

Player: The head of the goblin leader should be rotting soon. I place the head down on the ground, remove the heads of the hobgoblins and place it in a straight line in the exit away from direct view of the camp. My aim is to create a scene where the goblins that have exited far enough away from the den will see the pile of corpses and heads of the stronger goblins and be terrified. In that moment, my knives will come flying.

DM: Your plan is one of masterful psychological warfare. You retrieve the warboss's head and sever the heads of the four hobgoblins. Around a blind corner, a hundred yards from the quarry entrance, you create a gruesome tableau. You place the warboss’s head in the center of the path, flanked by the four hobgoblin heads. Behind them, you pile the thirty-five corpses into a massive, tangled mound. It is a deliberate, intelligent, and deeply unsettling message: This is what happens when you leave. With your stage set, you retreat to a new hiding place. You wait.

Player: I repeat the process of improving Ford Bronco’s body today while replenishing mana. Does anything happen?

DM: The day unfolds in the now-familiar rhythm. You absorb mana, expend half of it to continue Ford Bronco's augmentation, and then return to your meditation.
Roll: 77 (Major Event)

The response comes in the late afternoon. A roar of pure, intelligent fury echoes from the quarry. Then, the horde emerges. It is not a raiding party; it is an exodus. The chieftain is moving the entire den, a chaotic swarm of nearly a hundred goblins. They march forward, directly towards your gruesome tableau. The chieftain himself, the ultimate prize, is exposed in the center of his terrified horde.

What do you do?

Player: If I had the luxury, I would decimate his entire horde and then taunt him. I do not. He will be my highest value target. When they spot my... art. That is the moment my daggers come flying.

DM: The front of the column rounds the corner and sees the line of severed heads and the mountain of corpses. A collective gasp of horrified shrieks ripples back through the horde. In that perfect moment of absolute chaos, the chieftain stands completely still, a look of utter, furious disbelief on his ugly face. He is a perfect target.

    Acknowledged. Acquiring single-target saturation solution. Trajectories locked.

You rise. Flick-flick-flick-flick-flick-flick. Six dark streaks of steel bridge the distance.
Rolls: 99, 97, 94, 98, 100, 96. (A Flawless Salvo of Critical Hits)

The result is an annihilation. The chieftain is thrown backwards, his body riddled with your knives. The unique, human-like spark in his mana signature extinguishes. The rival player is dead. The goblin horde, their minds utterly broken, dissolves into a mindless, panicked rout, scattering in every direction. The goblin den of the quarry is no more.

Player: I mutter to myself "Your soul is mine." I command Gemini to identify this player’s power that I have claimed for myself.

DM: A focused, coherent stream of esoteric information flows from the dead player’s dissipating soul into your own.

    Analysis Complete.
    Ability Acquired: [Horde Commander]
    Description: A Class-based ability centered on the leadership and passive enhancement of subordinate, low-intelligence, "mob-type" creatures.
    Core Effects: [Aura of Command], [Minion Enhancement], [Hive Mind].
    Current Status: DORMANT.

You have not just gained experience; you have stolen the very essence of your rival’s power.

Player: I think to myself: The core of this power is to amplify and reduce the cost of exerting your will to manipulate and control, but this moron applied it specifically to cannon fodder. System Gemini, let's restore this ability to the true essence of control.

DM:

    Acknowledged. Commencing deep-level analysis and conceptual restructuring... Process Complete.
    Ability Evolved: [Lord of the Ascendant State]
    Description: A conceptual ability centered on the amplification and optimization of any hierarchical structure you command.
    Core Effects:

        [Aura of Presence (Passive)]: You exude an aura of profound competence and authority that subordinates instinctively recognize.

        [Sovereign’s Boon (Active)]: You can designate a subordinate as a 'lieutenant', granting them a fraction of your own capabilities.

        [The Director’s Voice (Active)]: You can issue silent, instantaneous, and complex telepathic commands to any subordinate.

You have successfully transformed a crude tool for managing cannon fodder into a sophisticated system for creating and commanding an elite, hyper-efficient organization.

Player: I chop off the head of this imbecile as proof of my kill. I also check the dropped items on the ground for valuable loot.

DM: You sever the chieftain’s head.
Roll: 94 (Critical Success)

Your search yields a treasure trove:

    The Sword: Goblin-King’s Blade (+1). A Copper Tier magical arming sword with the [Cleaving Edge +1] property.

    The Pouch: 2 Gold Pieces (gp), 38 Silver Pieces (sp), and 112 Bronze Pieces (bp).

    The Hidden Chest:

        Item 1: Seeds of the Shadow-Vine. A Bronze Tier alchemical reagent.

        Item 2: Sealed Collegium Scroll (Teleportation Matrix). A Silver Tier consumable that will teleport the user to the Mage's Collegium in the capital city of Bordeaux.

You have struck a motherlode.

Player: Wait. What about the captured women who are used for breeding? I need to rescue them.

DM: A chilling realization cuts through your triumph. The women. The chieftain’s personal cave is the most logical place they would have been kept. You stride to the large cave entrance. A foul stench wafts out. Inside, huddled in the far corner and chained to the rock wall, are about a dozen women, malnourished but alive. They see you, an armored figure silhouetted against the daylight, and flinch in terror. One, a young woman with defiant eyes, snarls, "Get back. Don’t you touch her!" They do not see a rescuer. They see a threat.

What do you do?

Player: I whistle for Ford Bronco to come over. I take off my helmet to reveal my face. I hand out provisions for them to eat first.

DM: You whistle. Ford Bronco trots into view. The sight of the familiar beast is the first crack in their wall of terror. You remove your helmet, revealing the face of a boy. You place your scavenged cheese and sausage on the ground, then take three steps back. "Eat," you say. "You are safe now. The goblins are gone."

The sight of real food is a powerful truth. The defiant young woman’s resolve breaks. With a choked sob, she nods to the others. Slowly, cautiously, they shuffle forward and tear into the food with a desperate, animalistic hunger. They are eating. They are safe. But they are still in chains.

What do you do?

Player: I silently wait for them to finish eating. Then I look at them. "Those of you who have been defiled by goblins... If you suspect that you carry their children, I will help you end your misery."

DM: You wait as they finish. When they are done, you walk forward and look at their chains. You grip the rusty links and, with your STR 11, you simply pull, snapping the iron with a screech of protesting metal. One by one, you break their chains.

"The goblins are gone," you say, your voice low and even. "You are free. I will take all of you back to Rochefort." You pause. "But I know your ordeal may not be over. Some of you may carry... consequences of your captivity. I know the shame and the fear you may face. For those of you who cannot face that future... I can offer a final mercy. A quick, painless end. It is a terrible choice, but it is a choice I will grant you, if you ask for it."

The women stare at you, their faces a mixture of shock, horror, and despair. The choice is theirs.

Player: I turn around and leave, guiding Ford Bronco. As I turn around, I speak: "Come, let's go home. Those of you who need it... look for me tonight."

DM: You do not wait for their answer. You turn your back, a gesture of trust in their agency. "Come," you say. "Let’s go home." You begin to walk. Behind you, after a moment's hesitation, you hear the soft, shuffling footsteps of broken people choosing to live. As you continue the journey back towards Rochefort, you add, "Those of you who need it... look for me tonight. At The Salty Boar. I will be waiting."

Player: I check into the guild with the head of the chieftain.

DM: The sun has set by the time your grim procession reaches Rochefort. The city guard gently takes charge of the rescued women. You head to the Adventurer’s Guild. A hush falls as you enter. You walk to the counter where Kaelen is closing his books. You uncinch your sack and the severed head of the goblin chieftain rolls out onto the counter. "The contract for the goblin den in the quarry is complete."

Kaelen stares in pure, unadulterated disbelief. You have completed two Bronze-tier contracts in a single day. "Gods have mercy," he whispers. "Arthur... what in the seven hells are you?"

Player: I reply "I'm just a guy, lucky to grow up in the shadows of heroes protecting our realms, clinching small victories." Now, my payment please.

DM: Your humble, patriotic answer is a masterpiece of misdirection. Awe begins to replace fear in the eyes of the other adventurers. "Now," you continue, "my payment, please." Kaelen, jolted back to his duties, counts out forty silver pieces. You now possess 108 silver. "Dispose of the heads as you see fit," you say, turning to leave. "The Guild can keep whatever they’re worth."

Player: Some minor edits: I will just be a folklore for a few months at best. Keep in mind that the power scale in this story is incredible and I'm just slightly above the bottom. Anyway, it is late now and I head to the inn for a large 5 portion meal.

DM: You are correct. In the grand, brutal theater of Aethel, you are a local legend, a tavern story, but still just a boy at the foot of a very tall mountain. You walk back to The Salty Boar. News of your deeds has preceded you. A wave of silence follows you to the bar. "A room," you state. "And five portions of the Boar’s Feast." Megara quirks an eyebrow at the new record but simply slaps a key on the counter. "Room seven. Four silver for the lot. In advance." You pay her without a word. After your massive meal, you sit in the quiet of your room. You are safe, wealthy, and powerful. And you are waiting. Waiting for a knock on the door that may, or may not, come.

Player: I tip Pip 100 copper coins and get him to clean my armors and weapons. I request for him to also use some of that money to buy a simple white tunic and pants and slippers so that I can wear it during rest.

DM: When Pip arrives to clear the five empty platters, you count out one hundred copper coins. "This is for you," you say. "I have two tasks." Pip stares, mouth agape. "First, clean my armor and weapons. Perfectly. Second, use some of this money to buy me a simple white tunic, pants, and slippers. You may keep the change." A look of fierce, trembling loyalty dawns on Pip's face. "S-sir... I won’t fail you!" For the price of one silver piece, you have purchased the absolute, unwavering loyalty of a local boy. You are left alone in the heavy silence. All that is left is the waiting.

Player: I activate sentinel sleep as I organize my gains. Do I also level up?

DM: As you settle in, you run a final analysis. The death of the transmigrator chieftain was not like killing a simple monster.

    Analysis Complete.

        Primary Energy Source: Esoteric resonance from the neutralized transmigrator chieftain (Unique, High-Quality).

        Result: A massive, high-potency influx of esoteric energy has been absorbed.

    Acknowledged. Engaging...

In the deepest, quietest part of the night, a soft, hesitant, almost inaudible tap comes at your door.

    ALERT! CONDITION MET.

The choice you offered in the cave has come home. What do you do?

Player: I open the door as I assign 6 points into my agility, crossing the threshold into 11. My physical prowess should be that of my prime earth days now. I inspect the girls, how many are there? I lead them to the church for 1 final prayer.

DM: Before your hand touches the door, you make a decision.

    Acknowledged. Allocating 6 points to AGI.
    Agility: 5 -> 11
    Threshold Crossed: 10 (Copper Tier).

The change is instantaneous and electrifying. A feeling of lightness and absolute control. The physical prowess of your prime is yours once more. You open the door. Three women stand there: the defiant young woman and two older women, their faces masks of grim, hollow-eyed resignation. They have made their choice.

You pull on the simple white tunic and trousers Pip brought you. You are not a warrior right now. You lead them, a silent, ghostly procession, through the empty, torchlit streets to the town’s church. You push open the heavy oak doors and lead them inside. The air is cold and heavy with the scent of old stone and incense. You lead the three women to the front pew. "Pray," you say, your voice a low, quiet command. "Make your peace. I will wait."

Player: I wait for them to finish their prayer as I sing out a song: "妳要離開 我知道很簡單, 妳說依賴 , 是我們的阻礙, 就算放開 但能不能別沒收我的愛, 當作我最後才明白"

DM: As their whispered, broken prayers find their rhythm, a sound, soft as a breath, breaks the hallowed silence. You begin to sing, your voice a quiet, personal lament. The words are alien, but the women understand the language of pain. The melody is a slow, haunting river of grief. It is not for them, truly, but a requiem you have carried in your soul for an age. The strange, sad music does not frighten them. It envelops them, a final, unexpected solace. The final note fades into silence. The women have finished their prayers. They rise and turn to face you. The terror is gone. All that remains is a profound, soul-deep weariness, and a quiet, solemn acceptance. They are ready.

Player: I head out to the church’s backyard. I pick a nice spot for them. I tell them that I will cover their eyes with two silver coins, which will pay for their burial. I will also wait at the abbey and inform the priest.

DM: You lead them through a side exit into the church’s graveyard. Beneath the branches of a massive, ancient yew tree, you turn to face them. You hold out six silver coins. "This world has a tradition," you say. "The dead are buried with coins to pay the ferryman. I will place these over your eyes. They will serve that purpose, and they will pay the church for your consecrated burial. I will go to the abbey next door and awaken the priest myself. He will see to your rites." The defiant young woman looks at her companions, then at you. A flicker of profound, weary gratitude is in her eyes. "Thank you," she whispers. They turn their backs to you, looking out at the coming dawn.

Player: I dispatch them in a swift and painless way and lay them down orderly, with the silver coins covering their eyes. Then head to wake the priest up, recounting the tale.

DM: You move with the speed and silence your new agility grants you. This is an act of mercy, and the greatest mercy is speed. A single, sharp, brutally efficient twist for each. It is over in less than five seconds. You lay them down side-by-side and place the gleaming silver coins upon their eyelids.

You knock on the door of the rectory. A bleary-eyed, middle-aged priest peers out. "Father," you say, "I have brought you three souls who require their final rites." You recount the tale, edited for this holy man. You do not explicitly state your role in their deaths; you let him fill in the terrible, unspoken blanks. The priest, a man who understands the profound horrors of the world, stares at you, his face pale. "The coins..." he whispers. "They are paid for," you state. "Six silver for their passage, and for the church’s care." The priest closes his eyes. "May the Archangels have mercy on us all," he says, his voice heavy. "I will see to them. Go, son. Leave this to the church." He closes the door, leaving you alone as the first rays of the morning sun crest the rooftops. Your terrible duty is done.

Player: I head back to the inn to collect my cleaned items and have another 5 portion breakfast.

DM: You walk back to The Salty Boar to find Pip waiting with your now-immaculate gear. You give him a few bronze pieces for his diligence, then take your gear to your room and change back into your armor. Downstairs, you order five portions of whatever Megara is cooking. You eat your massive breakfast, the hot food a comfort, washing away the cold touch of the night’s work. When you are finished, you pay your dues and step out into the full, bright morning. You have two more days until the caravan to Veridia departs.

Player: Actually, a night or two passed at the goblin den, so today should be the day we set off. But I should have time to visit the blacksmith one more time.

DM: You are correct. A quick consultation with Gemini’s internal chronometer confirms it.

    Day 5 (Today): Departure day for the Aldric’s Fine Wools caravan.

The caravan leaves at dawn, and dawn has already broken. There is still time, but it is measured in hours. After your breakfast, you have one final stop. You find Borin already hard at work. "Back again, Arthur?" he rumbles. "Decided you need a suit of plate after all?"

Player: I request to offload my extra sword. I will be using the goblin king’s blade. I look for another weapon: a mace, for combat with armored targets. Next, I offload my leather armor for that combination expensive armor that he was talking about. Finally, I check if I can increase my stock of throwing knives. 6 is too little, and I am much stronger now. Can I do 24 knives? How much gold do I have left?

DM: Your requests are direct and professional. Borin agrees to the trades and new purchases.

    Sell: Shortsword (+1 silver)

    Buy: Flanged Mace (-5 silver)

    Buy: 18 more throwing knives with two custom-fit bandoliers (-30 silver)

    Upgrade: Trade studded leather (credit of 15 silver) for the coat of plates (-65 silver)

    Total Owed: 99 Silver.

    Remaining: 1 Gold, 109 Silver, 147 Bronze, 217 Copper.

The next hour is a blur of activity. You pay the ninety-nine silver. Borin helps you into the magnificent coat of plates. His apprentices fit you with two new bandoliers, bristling with twenty-four throwing knives. You are no longer a lightly equipped boy. You are a walking fortress. "Be safe on the road, Arthur," Borin says with a craftsman’s pride. You thank him and head for the south gate. The caravan is waiting.

Player: I join the caravan. Who is there?

DM: You arrive at the south gate to a scene of organized chaos. Three large wagons are laden with woolen bales. The man in charge is Caravan Master Aldric, a shrewd-looking merchant in his late forties. With him are the other four guards:

    The Brothers (Torvin & Bror): Two brawny sell-swords armed with heavy axes. The muscle.

    The Ranger (Elara): A lean, wiry woman with a longbow and sharp, intelligent eyes. The scout.

    The Veteran (Gregor): A grizzled, one-eyed man in his fifties with a heavy spear and the weary look of a campaign survivor. The anchor.

Aldric looks up from his ledger and sees you. He is clearly taken aback by your masterwork gear. "Arthur?" he asks. The other guards turn, their expressions a mixture of surprise, curiosity, and, from the veteran, deep suspicion.

Player: I reply to the Caravan Master Aldric: "At your service" and find my place beside the veteran. I give my fellow guards a nod of acknowledgement. I gesture to Ford Bronco to move to the back of the caravan to follow.

DM: "At your service," you say. You give a nod to the other guards. The brothers grunt in reply. Elara gives a curt, almost imperceptible nod. You choose your position deliberately, beside the one-eyed veteran, Gregor. He gives you a long, slow appraisal. "Fancy kit for a Copper-rank," he grunts. It is a challenge. With a silent command from your [Director’s Voice], Ford Bronco trots to the end of the three-wagon train, taking up the rearguard position. Aldric claps his ledger shut. "Alright, let’s move!" The long, slow journey south to Veridia begins.

Player: I take it easy and let the ranger do her job and ponder the concepts of very economically using micro amounts of mana to enable gravity control on my weapons, making my swing light and swift, as if swinging a twig, then transitioning to strong gravity to increase the weight and power of my swings. This is in combination with considerations with air resistance.

DM: The caravan settles into the monotonous rhythm of the road. While your eyes are on the road, your mind is a universe away.

    Acknowledged. This is a highly advanced, Transcendent-tier concept. Proceeding with theoretical modeling...

Your mind becomes a laboratory. You theorize a new combat style: 'Variable Mass Combat'.

    Phase 1: The Swing. Wrap your weapon in a field that convinces it that it is nearly weightless. The speed you could generate would be breathtaking.

    Phase 2: The Impact. At the last microsecond before contact, reverse the polarity, flooding the weapon with a crushing gravitational force, making it weigh not five pounds, but five hundred.

    Phase 3: The Refinement. Add a simultaneous field to create a perfect aerodynamic envelope, eliminating air resistance. Apply the concept to your shield to make it an immovable anchor, or to your own body for absolute stability.

"See something interesting out there, boy?" Gregor’s gruff voice cuts through your concentration. You have been staring intently at your hand axe for the better part of an hour. "Just thinking," you murmur. Gregor grunts, his one good eye narrowing. He knows the quiet, strange boy walking beside him is more than he seems. And he is, for the first time, a little bit afraid of what that might be.
